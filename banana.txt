Banana
Banana is one of the important fruits cultivated in the tropics. India ranks first in the world in the area and yield of banana cultivation. In Andhra Pradesh, banana is cultivated in approximately 99,372 hectares, with a production of 5.8 million tonnes, ranking first in India. Although banana is cultivated in almost all districts of the state, it is mainly grown in East Godavari, West Godavari, Kadapa, Anantapuram, Guntur, Kurnool, Vizianagaram, Krishna, and Srikakulam districts.   
Climate: Banana is a tropical crop, and an average temperature of 25-30 degrees Celsius is very suitable. The temperature should not be less than 15 degrees Celsius in winter.   
Soils: Fertile soils with adequate water availability, good drainage, and sufficient organic matter are suitable. Fertile alluvial soils are best. The soil should be 1.0 to 1.5 meters deep, and it is good to have a pH of 6.5 to 7.5. Except for completely sandy and saline soils, bananas can be cultivated in all other soils with drainage facilities. However, banana cultivation is more expensive in shallow soils.   
Soil Preparation: The land should be plowed to a depth of 30-40 cm in summer. This helps to control soil-borne pests and weeds. It should be plowed 3-4 times with a harrow during the early monsoon rains to make it fine. Pits of 45x45x45 cm length, width, and depth should be dug at the required spacing for the selected variety.   
Varieties: Like all crops, there are various varieties of bananas under cultivation. Some of these are used for cooking, and some are used as fruit. The banana varieties under cultivation each have their own specialty.   
Fruit Varieties:
1.Karpoora Chekkerakeli: This is an important variety grown indigenously. It grows up to about 2.5-3 meters in height. It is prone to falling due to winds. Therefore, it must be supported with bamboo. It has a duration of 11-12 months and yields an average of 30 tonnes per hectare with bunches weighing an average of 16-18 kg. It can withstand water stress. It is resistant to Panama disease and leaf spot diseases.   
2.White Chekkerakeli: This variety is mainly cultivated in the East and West Godavari, Krishna, and Guntur districts. It grows to about 2.5 meters in height and is prone to falling due to winds. Therefore, it must be supported. Its duration is 11-12 months. Bunches weigh an average of 6-8 kg and have 5-6 hands. Each bunch has approximately 70-80 fruits. The fruits are thick and have a high sugar content. It yields an average of 15 tonnes per hectare. It is easily susceptible to rhizome rot disease.   
3.Grand Naine: This variety has been increasingly cultivated recently. It is shorter than the Big Green Banana and is a high-yielding variety. The crop duration is 10-11 months. The average bunch weight is 28-30 kg and has 9-10 hands. It yields an average of 65-75 tonnes per hectare. It is resistant to Panama disease but is easily susceptible to leaf spot disease. The karshi crop also yields well.   
4.Dwarf Green Banana: Dwarf Green Banana is also known as "Dwarf Cavendish" and "Basrai." It grows to a height of 1.5 meters and being short, it is possible to plant more plants per acre and get a higher yield. It is highly resistant to winds. But it cannot withstand water stress. Its duration is 10-11 months. Bunches weigh an average of 15-16 kg and have 8-10 hands, yielding an average of 45-50 tonnes per hectare. It is a suitable variety for coastal areas with high summer winds and storms. It is resistant to Panama disease but not to leaf spot and bunchy top diseases. It is not suitable for karshi gardens.   
5.Martaman: Martaman banana is also known as "Bengal Amritapani." This variety is also very suitable for commercial cultivation. It is largely resistant to Panama disease but is susceptible to rhizome rot disease. It grows to a height of approximately 2.5 to 3.0 meters. Bunches weigh 18-20 kg and yield an average of 45 tonnes per hectare.   
6.Red Chekkerakeli: It is an attractive colored variety that gives high income. The cultivation of this variety has been gradually increasing in recent times. Its duration is 15-16 months. Bunches weigh an average of 12-15 kg and have 5-6 hands. Each bunch has approximately 60-80 fruits. These fruits are high in beta-carotene.   
Cooking Varieties:
1.Kovvuru Bontha: Kovvuru Bontha is an important cooking variety. Bunches weigh an average of 18-20 kg and have 5-6 hands with 70-80 fruits. The fruits are large, light green in color, and attractive, so there is a chance of getting a higher price. The duration is 12-13 months. It is resistant to leaf spot disease. It can be cultivated perennially. It can withstand water stress but is susceptible to rhizome rot disease.   
2.Godavari Bontha: This variety yields more than Kovvuru Bontha. Bunches weigh an average of 20-25 kg and have 7-8 hands with 100-200 fruits. The fruits are of good quality, and there is a chance of getting a good price. It can withstand water stress. But it is susceptible to rhizome rot disease.   
Planting Time: White Chekkerakeli, Karpoora Chekkerakeli, and Bontha varieties can be planted throughout the year. However, it is best to plant between April and August. Dwarf Green Banana and Big Green Banana varieties can be planted after the early monsoon rains, from June to September 15, and also in February and March.   
Selection and Preparation of Suckers: Suckers should be selected only from healthy gardens that are free from viral diseases. Only sword suckers that are three months old and have two or three leaves should be chosen. Digging and planting of suckers should not be given on contract. Do not collect seed suckers from other states without awareness of pests and diseases. Digging should be done by laborers under the supervision of the farmer. The outer skin of the suckers should be thinly scraped and dipped in a solution of 5 grams of copper oxychloride per liter of water for 15 minutes, and then planted.   
Planting Suckers: To plant the suckers, 300 grams of single superphosphate and 5 kg of well-decomposed cattle manure should be added to the soil dug from the pit and mixed well. The planting distance depends on the banana variety. Dwarf Green Banana, which grows short, should be planted at a distance of 1.5x1.5 meters; Grand Naine and White Chekkerakeli, which grow moderately, should be planted at a distance of 1.8x1.8 meters; and Martaman, Karpoora Chekkerakeli, and Kovvuru Bontha, which grow tall, should be planted at a distance of 2.0x2.0 meters. The treated seed suckers should be planted at a depth of 5.0 to 7.5 cm in leveled soil. After planting the suckers, water should be applied for the first time with pots. Two or three days after planting and watering the suckers, the soil around the suckers should be pressed firmly to prevent air from entering.   
Planting in Twin Rows (High Density): By planting banana varieties at the highest possible density according to their growth characteristics, the land can be used efficiently, and higher yields can be obtained.   
Table:
Varieties	Distance in Twin Rows	Distance Between Two Twin Rows	Percentage Increase Compared to Normal
White Chekkerakeli, Grand Naine	1.2 x 1.2 m	2.0 m	69%
Dwarf Green Banana/Vamana Keli	1.0 x 1.0 m	1.8 m	68%

Twin Row Planting Method:
When planting in twin rows, the distance between rows should be small (1.2 m or 1.0 m). The distance between two twin rows should be large (2.0 or 1.8 m). The plants in the second row should be planted in the middle of the plants in the first row, not directly opposite them. Fertilizers should be applied to each plant as recommended. When planted at high density, the crop duration increases by 40-50 days. The height also increases, so appropriate precautions should be taken. In the space between the twin rows, intercrops with a duration of 100-120 days (leafy vegetables, cabbage, cauliflower, maize, etc.) can be cultivated to obtain additional income.  
Production of Banana Plants by Macro-Propagation Method:
This method involves developing a technique to produce disease-free, high-yielding plants in a short time by selecting suckers from high-quality banana mother plants. Using this method, a large number of plants of traditional varieties and newly released banana varieties can be produced. In this method, first, high-quality mature banana suckers (6 months old) are selected, and the tissue in the center (2 cm deep) is removed, and 6 to 8 vertical and horizontal cuts are made with a knife. The suckers prepared in this way are planted in a mixture of 2 kg of sawdust + 30 g of Mycorrhiza (AMF) + 30 g of Bacillus subtilis, and 4 ml of B.A.P 0.04% solution is applied to each sucker. The first generation suckers are produced from the buds on the rhizome in 15-20 days. When these suckers have 2-3 leaves (2.5 cm plant base circumference), the top part is removed, and 4 to 6 cuts are made to produce the 2nd generation suckers, and subsequently, the 3rd generation suckers are produced using this method. 30 to 50 banana plants can be produced from each sucker (rhizome) in 3 to 4 months. The third generation suckers are separated and planted in polythene bags with a mixture of cattle manure and red soil, which develops a good root system, grows well in a month, and is ready for planting in the main field with 4 to 5 leaves.   
Tissue Culture Banana Plants:
Tissue culture refers to plants developed in the laboratory from the tissue of high-quality banana suckers. Plants developed from tissue collected from healthy, strong suckers are disease-free and healthy. When planted in the field, they grow quickly and strongly, yielding up to 35-45 percent more than normal sucker crops. The entire garden produces bunches at the same time, and since all the bunches are harvested in a very short period, the garden management cost is low. Karshi crops also grow strongly and give high yields.   
Fertilizer Management:
Fertilizers should be applied to each banana plant by counting them individually. Applying fertilizers per acre is not a correct method since some varieties are planted at low density and some at high density. All banana varieties should be given 50 grams of phosphorus fertilizer per plant. Banana plants use phosphorus fertilizer only for a short period after planting. Therefore, phosphorus fertilizer should not be applied as a top dressing. Even if applied, there will be no result. As mentioned above, it is best to mix the phosphorus fertilizer, in the form of superphosphate, with the soil dug from the pit at the time of planting the sucker. When superphosphate is used, nutrients such as sulfur and calcium in it are also available to the crop. Therefore, complex fertilizers should not be used.   
Method of Using Nitrogen and Potash Fertilizers:
Variety	Nitrogen to be Applied	Potash to be Applied	Nitrogen Dose per Plant	Potash Dose per Plant	Days After Planting to Apply Fertilizers
Fertile Normal Soils					
1. Karpoora Chekkerakeli, Kovvuru Bontha (Long-term varieties)	200	200	4	50	50

For karshi crops, apply 80% of the above doses, reducing the duration.   
Nitrogen and potash fertilizers should be applied to the banana plant at a distance of 30-40 cm on both sides and covered with soil in 10 cm deep pits. A light irrigation should be given every time fertilizers are applied. If more water is applied, the applied fertilizers dissolve in the water and go into the deeper layers of the soil along with the water and are not available to the plant. Therefore, the desired result is not achieved.   
Method of Applying Fertilizers to Tissue Culture Banana Plants:
Tissue culture plants are small and start growing immediately after planting. Growth is faster than that of normally planted suckers. They also use the applied fertilizers efficiently. Since they are very small at the time of planting, good results can be obtained by applying the nitrogen and potash fertilizers recommended for sucker crops in very small doses and more frequently.   
Method of Applying Fertilizers to Tissue Culture Banana Plants in the Irrigation Method:
Variety	Dose to be Applied per Plant	Days After Planting to Apply Fertilizers

Drip Irrigation and Fertilizer Management:
The efficiency of water and fertilizer use increases and saves due to the drip method. When applying nitrogen and potash fertilizers through drip irrigation, 60 percent of the recommended fertilizers are sufficient in heavy soils, and 75 percent in light soils.   
Dose of Fertilizers to be Applied to Green Banana Varieties through Drip Irrigation (per plant):
Plant Age	Heavy Soils	Light Soils
	Urea (g)	Muriate of Potash (g)
From 3rd week of planting to 6th week (once every three days)	4.0	3.0
From 7th week to 14th week (once every three days)	4.7	4.0
From 15th week to 24th week (once every three days) From 31st week to 35th week (after bunch formation) (once every three days)	5.0 4.7	4.5 4.0

Depending on the plant density in one acre, multiply the above-mentioned fertilizers by the number of plants to determine the total fertilizer required. Example: 4 grams of Urea x 1250 plants = 5 kilos (per acre).   
For Karpoora and White Chakkerakeli varieties, apply the above fertilizers through drip irrigation every three days from the 15th to the 27th week.   
Even after bunch formation, from the 33rd to the 38th week, use the fertilizers recommended above again.   
Note: To correct micronutrient deficiencies in bananas, apply 2 kilos of micronutrient mixture (Iron, Copper, Manganese, Molybdenum, Zinc, and Boron) per acre through drip irrigation in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th months after planting.   
To obtain high net income and quality bunches in bananas, using all types of resources effectively, various management methods must be followed.   
Especially, 80% of the water evaporating from the plant and soil should be provided through drip irrigation.   
Depending on the soil fertility, 75% of the recommended fertilizers should be provided through fertigation. 20 grams of 'Banana Shakti' micronutrient mixture should be mixed in 1 liter of water and sprayed once in the 4th, 5th, and 6th months after planting.   
After bunch formation, 2% Sulfate of Potash should be sprayed on the bunches twice (once after removing the male flower and the second time 30 days later).   
Fertilizer management in ratoon crops: There is no need to apply phosphorus fertilizers additionally to the ratoon crop.   
Nitrogen and Potash fertilizers can be applied at 20% less than the recommended dose to obtain normal yields.   
Similar to the main crops, Nitrogen and Potash fertilizers should be applied to ratoon crops in 4 or 6 installments.   
After the sucker emerges, the application of Nitrogen and Potash fertilizers should be completed by 120 days for long-term varieties and 100 days for short-term varieties.   
Organic Banana Cultivation: If bananas are cultivated using organic fertilizers in the method described below, there is a possibility to obtain high yields and quality fruits.   
The recommended dose of 200g: 50g: 200g of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potash fertilizer per banana plant should be applied as described below.   


The following table:
1.	Well-decomposed cattle manure - 10
2.	Neem cake - 1.25
3.	Mycorrhiza - 25
4.	Trichoderma harzianum - 50
5.	Azospirillum - 50
6.	Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (P.S.B) - 50   
Green Manures:
1.	At the time of planting, sow sunn hemp between the plants and plow it in after 45 days.   
2.	After a ten-day gap, sow cowpea and plow it in after 30 days. Cowpea should be sown twice with a 10-day interval.   
3.	(Green manure should be completed within 150 days).   
Three months after planting - Vermicompost - 5 kg/plant   
Five months after planting - Wood ash - 1.75 kg/plant, if wood ash is not available, rice husk ash - 3.5 kg/plant should be applied.   
Water Management: Depending on the season, soil, and weather conditions, the banana crop should be irrigated approximately 30-40 times.   
Irrigation should be given once every 7 to 10 days depending on the local conditions.   
When the temperature is above 38° Celsius, irrigate every four days. A light irrigation should be given every time fertilizers are applied.   
When water is given to bananas through drip irrigation, the time period is reduced by 20-30 days. Yield increases up to 20 percent.   
Weeds can be controlled, and water can be saved up to 40 percent, and fertilizers up to 25-50 percent. Pest and disease problems are reduced.   
Intercropping: Banana is a long-term crop.   
Due to planting at a greater distance and frequent irrigation, there is a higher chance of weeds growing in the empty space.   
Additional income can be obtained by growing short-term intercrops in the empty space.   
The intercrop should be selected based on the banana variety, planting season, weather conditions, and market suitability.   
Intercrops should be planted in appropriate proportions. Planting at high density may delay the main banana crop.   
Fertilizers designated for the intercrop should be applied separately, regardless of the fertilizers applied to the banana. A space of 60 cm should be left around the banana plant when planting intercrops.   
Intercrops such as colocasia, yam, turmeric, maize, leafy vegetables, onion, cauliflower, and cabbage can be grown.   
Weed Control, Intercultivation: Apply Alachlor 2.5 liters or Pendimethalin 2.5 liters or Oxyfluorfen 500-600 ml per hectare. Mix any one of these chemicals in approximately 500 liters of water and spray evenly after planting and the first irrigation, when the soil is moist, to prevent weed germination.   
To eradicate grown weeds, spray Paraquat 2.5-4.0 liters mixed in 600-1000 liters of water per hectare on the weeds.   
Sow cowpea or black-eyed pea seeds (once every 40-50 days, and again for the second time after 70 days) and plow them into the soil.   
This not only prevents weed growth but also increases soil fertility.   
If a 100-micron thick polythene mulching sheet is laid on the soil and then the plants are planted, weed problems can be effectively overcome, and water can be saved.   
Subsequent Precautions: Suckers develop from 3-4 months after planting bananas. Suckers should be removed every 20-25 days until half of the banana bunch is formed.   
Removing suckers regularly helps the mother plant grow well and provide a high yield.   
Large suckers should be dug out with a sharp crowbar, along with a small portion of the rhizome, to prevent them from growing back.   
Earthing up the base of the banana plant 6-8 months after planting helps the plant grow strong.   
In areas with high winds, provide support to banana plants by staking them with bamboo sticks to withstand the wind.   
If the banana trees are cut into small pieces where they are, they dry quickly, decompose, and mix with the soil, transforming into organic fertilizer and increasing soil fertility.   
Suggestions for quality bunch yield: Covering the bunches with 2% perforated white transparent polythene bags increases the size of the fruits, makes them appear attractive with a light green color, and helps obtain quality fruits suitable for export.   

Nutrient Deficiencies - Correction:
o	Potash Deficiency - Prevention: Potash deficiency is more common in winter. The edges of the leaves turn yellow and gradually the entire leaf turns yellow and dries out. Apply 80 grams of Muriate of Potash per plant four times at forty-day intervals. Spray 5 grams of Sulfate of Potash per liter of water on the leaves 2 or 3 times at 7 to 10-day intervals.   
o	Zinc Deficiency - Prevention: White streaks appear along the veins of the leaves, and the leaves appear pale. A dark purple color forms on the underside of the leaves. To prevent this, apply 10 grams of Zinc Sulfate per plant to the soil. Spray 2 grams of Zinc Sulfate per liter of water on the leaves 2-3 times at 10-day intervals.   
o	Boron Deficiency - Prevention: The veins of the leaves are swollen, and the leaves are stiff and brittle. Vertical streaks (parallel to the main vein) form on the leaves. To prevent this, spray 0.1% Borax on the leaves twice at 10-day intervals.   
o	Sulfur Deficiency - Prevention: Newly emerging young leaves are very light in color and take a long time to turn green. Sulfur-containing fertilizers can be used to correct the deficiency.   
Iron Deficiency - Prevention: When iron is deficient, young leaves have white streaks. When the deficiency is severe, young leaves turn completely white and gradually dry out. Plant growth is reduced. 3 grams of Ferrous Sulfate + 1 gram of Citric Acid per liter of water should be sprayed on the leaves until they are completely wet, twice at 10-day intervals, to prevent iron deficiency.   
Manganese Deficiency - Prevention: Manganese deficiency causes irregular yellow spots on older leaves. As days pass, the yellow spots dry out in the center. When the deficiency is severe, the leaves dry out completely. The young leaves of suckers have a white color with green streaks. When the deficiency is severe, the young white leaves dry out. The growth of suckers and the mother plant is reduced. 2 grams of Manganese Sulfate per liter of water should be sprayed on all leaves, 2-3 times at 10-day intervals, to correct Manganese deficiency.   
Banana Orchard Management in Summer: When summer temperatures exceed 45° Celsius and hot winds also blow, all types of banana orchards are severely affected. Green bananas (Grand Naine) are quickly affected by the summer heat. Dwarf Green Banana (Dwarf Cavendish), Karpoora Chakkerakeli, K.B.S-8 can withstand high temperatures to some extent. In summer, light soils can withstand the heat to a great extent if irrigated every 2 days, and heavy soils if irrigated every 4 days. Due to high temperatures, young leaves dry out first, followed by older leaves. Young bunches turn black and wither. Fruits in harvested bunches ripen quickly. The fruits become soft as if cooked, ooze water, and lose their normal taste and storage capacity. Bunches damaged by summer are not suitable for sale.   
Summer Damage and Management Methods based on Orchard Age: In summer, the leaves of orchards less than four months old completely dry out. If irrigation cannot be provided every 3 days, the stem and rhizome also dry out and rot. After the heat subsides, the plants sprout, and regular irrigation must be provided every 3 or 4 days for normal growth. Fertilizers should be applied in small doses, frequently and closely. If a large percentage of plants in one or two-month-old orchards die, they should be plowed and replanted in June and July. 
In summer, the leaves of orchards older than five months dry up. There is minimal damage to the rhizome and stem. Orchards of this age recover easily. Due to the short time available for bunch formation, they produce small bunches. Even if they produce large bunches, they do not ripen properly. Such orchards must be irrigated every 3 or 4 days without fail. Fertilizers should be applied 50 percent more than the recommended dose. At the time of bunch formation, based on the fruit development in the bunch, 5 grams of potassium nitrate or sulfate of potash should be mixed alternately with adhesive in one liter of water and sprayed four times at weekly intervals so that the leaves and bunches are completely drenched. In orchards that are forming bunches, ready to form bunches, and with young bunches (less than half-formed), the leaves completely wither and dry out due to intense sun and heatwaves. Banana bunches do not form properly and wither due to the heat. In green banana varieties, the bunches also fall off. Orchards in this stage suffer a lot of damage. There is no opportunity to compensate for the loss due to lack of time. Such orchards should be irrigated frequently. The entire bunch, including the peduncle, should be wrapped with dry leaves to protect it from the sun. Only when the sun's intensity decreases and the plant has 5 to 6 healthy leaves, can bunches that are marketable be produced. 5 grams of potassium nitrate or sulfate of potash should be mixed alternately with adhesive in one liter of water and sprayed four times at weekly intervals so that the leaves and bunches are completely drenched, which can reduce the damage to some extent. In orchards where the plant leaves have completely withered, it is better to grow the healthy suckers as a new orchard. In summer, the leaves and bunches of orchards with bunches that are half or more developed dry up. Trees fall down. Bunches harvested from such trees ripen quickly, lose taste, and have reduced shelf life. The fruits in such bunches appear cooked, and hence do not fetch a good price in the market. The bunches of such trees should be protected from the sun by wrapping them with dry leaves. Mature bunches should be harvested only in the cool morning hours and kept in a shaded place (away from sun and hot winds). Preventive measures: The loss to banana orchards can be reduced to some extent by planting 2-3 month old needle suckers in February-March. Planting fast-growing crops like Agathi (Sesbania) in 3-4 rows around the banana orchard will block hot winds. The banana orchard should be planted at the recommended spacing, and care should be taken to ensure that all plants in the orchard survive. Irrigation should be provided according to soil type and weather conditions during summer. Light soils should be irrigated every two to three days, and heavy soils every four to five days. From March onwards, potassium sulfate (0.5 percent) solution mixed with adhesive should be sprayed thoroughly over the crop every 10 to 15 days to help the banana withstand summer temperatures. In situations where water scarcity is anticipated during summer, spraying banana plants with 0.1 ml (180 mg / 10 liters of water) of acetylsalicylic acid beforehand can enhance their ability to withstand water stress.   
Pest and Disease Management:
Pests:
Nematodes: Nematodes cause significant damage by infesting banana plant roots. Some types of nematodes penetrate the roots and feed on the sap, causing streaks on the roots. Other types of nematodes cause the formation of galls (root-knots) on the roots. Nematode infestation weakens the roots and rhizome, preventing the plant from properly absorbing water and nutrients. As a result, the plants appear wilted. The edges of the leaves turn black and gradually the leaves dry out.   
Control Measures:
1.	Collect suckers from nematode-free orchards.   
2.	Peel the outer layer of the sucker's rhizome thinly, then dip it in a solution of copper oxychloride and monocrotophos, allow it to dry in the shade, and then plant it.   
3.	Plant bananas in deeply plowed and well-sun-dried soil in summer.   
4.	Practice crop rotation.   
5.	To reduce root lesion nematodes in the soil, plant bananas after sunn hemp.   
6.	Avoid crop rotation with tobacco, okra, tomato, etc., in soils with high populations of root-knot nematodes.   
7.	Planting marigolds in these soils and then planting bananas can significantly reduce root-knot nematodes.   
8.	In nematode-infested banana orchards, apply 25 to 40 grams of carbofuran granules per plant near the base, 10 cm deep, cover with soil, and water lightly.   
Rhizome Weevil: The rhizome weevil bores into and damages the rhizome. The banana plant appears wilted due to lack of water. The leaves show symptoms of water stress. If control measures are not taken immediately after symptoms appear, the plant gradually dries up. Control: As soon as symptoms appear, apply 40 grams of carbofuran (3G) granules or 10 grams of cartap hydrochloride (4G) per plant deeply into the soil near the base and cover with soil and water.   
Spiraling Whitefly: This insect has become a problem in bananas grown as intercrops in coconut plantations or in areas where coconut is cultivated. Whiteflies lay eggs in a spiral pattern on the underside of banana leaves. These insects feed in groups and suck sap from the leaves. When infested, they secrete a honeydew-like sticky substance, which leads to the development of sooty mold on the upper surface of the leaves, hindering photosynthesis and causing nutrient deficiency, ultimately reducing yield. Control: Spray Azadirachtin 10000 ppm at 3 ml per liter of water three times at monthly intervals, ensuring the undersides of the leaves are thoroughly wetted. If the presence of insects is observed on banana leaves, start spraying once a month.   
Diseases:
Sigatoka Leaf Spot: This disease is caused by a fungal pathogen. It affects the crop in all seasons. However, the intensity of the disease is high during the rainy season, i.e., from July to November. The Grand Naine, Dwarf Cavendish, and White Cavendish varieties are highly susceptible to this disease.   
Initially, small yellow spots appear on the leaves. Gradually, these spots enlarge, with a gray center. These spots turn brown and coalesce. When the disease is severe, the leaves dry up prematurely. If the disease is severe after bunch emergence, the loss is significant.   
Control Measures:
1.Grand Naine banana variety is not resistant to Sigatoka leaf spot disease.   
2.The intensity of Sigatoka leaf spot disease is high during the rainy season. Therefore, take preventive measures and implement control measures as soon as the disease is observed.   
3.Ensure that water does not stagnate in the orchards.   
4.Apply the recommended doses of nitrogen and potash fertilizers to the plants.   
5.Remove suckers around the mother plant regularly.   
6.Keep the orchards clean and weed-free.   
7.Before the onset of the rainy season, spray with Mancozeb 2.5 g/liter of water or Chlorothalonil 2 g/liter of water.   
8.When the disease is observed in the orchards, spray Propiconazole 1 ml/liter of water mixed with 10 ml of mineral oil three times at 25-day intervals.   
9.If the disease intensity is very high, spray the following fungicides at 25-day intervals.   
First spray: Propiconazole (1 ml) + Mineral oil (10 ml) / liter of water   
Second spray: Carbendazim + Mancozeb (1 g) + Mineral oil (10 ml) / liter of water
Third spray: Trifloxystrobin + Tebuconazole (1.4 g) + Mineral oil (10 ml) / liter of water
Fourth spray: Trifenconazole (1 ml) + Mineral oil (10 ml) / liter of water
If the disease intensity does not decrease with heavy rains, the above-mentioned fungicides can be sprayed again. Note: The above-mentioned fungicides should be sprayed only 45 days before harvesting the bunches. Otherwise, pesticide residues may remain in the fruits.   
Panama Disease: This disease spreads through infected suckers and soil. The Amrutha Pani variety is highly susceptible to this disease. The Bontha and White Cavendish varieties are affected by this disease under certain unfavorable conditions.   
Infected plants show yellowing of leaves from the bottom upwards, followed by drying, and the leaves break at the petiole and hang along the stem. Vertical cracks appear on the stem near the ground. Brown spots are visible when the rhizome of such plants is cut open. It is not possible to control this disease with chemicals. Therefore, cultivating banana varieties resistant to this disease is the only solution.   
Bacterial Rhizome Rot: The Grand Naine, Dwarf Cavendish, and White Cavendish varieties are highly susceptible to this disease. The disease intensity is high when the plants are young and the temperature is high. It also causes significant damage in older plants. The symptoms of this disease in older plants are similar to those of Panama disease.   
Rotting spots appear at the junction of the stem and rhizome, and gradually the rhizome rots. In newly planted suckers and young plants, the central leaf bud also rots, and the plant dies. In older plants,   
Vertical cracks appear on the stem. The top of the rhizome smells rotten. The bottom row of leaves turns yellow and dries out. Eventually, all the leaves dry out, and the plant dies. The disease also spreads to the suckers.   
Control Measures:
Varieties like "Pacha Arati" and "Tella Chakkarakeli," which are susceptible to this disease, should not be planted between February and June. Provide adequate water to the gardens during summer.   
For new plantings, suckers should only be collected from healthy areas that are free from the disease. The collected suckers should be dipped in a solution of copper oxychloride and monocrotophos, dried in the shade, and then planted.   
In gardens, diseased plants, along with their rhizomes, should be removed, chopped into small pieces outside the garden, and burned with dry waste. At the spot where the plants were removed, and around the base of healthy plants, the soil should be thoroughly drenched with a bleaching powder solution (25 grams per liter of water) or Pseudomonas (50 grams per liter of water) should be applied to each plant.   
In soils where this disease is problematic, crop rotation should be practiced with crops like paddy and sugarcane.   
Virus Diseases: It has been observed that bananas are mainly affected by four virus diseases.   
Bunchy Top: The growth of plants affected by this disease is stunted. The green color of the leaves decreases, and chlorosis is visible between the veins. Only the veins of the leaves remain green. The size of the leaves is reduced, and they become sword-like. Such leaves form a dense bunch at the crown. The plant can be affected by this disease at any stage. If the plant is affected at an early stage, it will not produce bunches. Even if diseased plants produce bunches, they are not properly formed. This virus disease spreads to new banana plantations through suckers. In the garden, this virus disease spreads from diseased plants to healthy plants through banana aphids.   
Infectious Chlorosis/Heart Rot: This disease affects all banana varieties. The intensity of this disease is high in "Karshi" gardens. The leaves of infected plants show chlorosis, and yellow or white streaks appear parallel to the veins. The veins become thick. The size of the leaves decreases. Sometimes, during cold weather, water spots appear on the crown leaves, gradually spreading to the stem and causing the crown to rot, leading to the death of the tree. This is known as the "Heart Rot" symptom. Diseased plants usually do not produce bunches. Even if they do, the bunches emerge from the middle of the stem or are crooked, and the fruits do not develop properly, resulting in poor market prices. This disease spreads to new plantations through banana suckers. In the garden, it spreads from virus-infected trees to the suckers of healthy plants through aphids. The spread of this disease is very high. Currently, this disease is prevalent in the banana gardens of the East and West Godavari districts. Therefore, banana suckers should not be collected from these districts for new plantings.   
Apple Disease (Bract Mosaic): This disease affects all banana varieties. Pink vertical stripes appear on the stem and suckers of plants affected by this disease. These stripes may be spindle-shaped or merge and run vertically. Small spindle-shaped stripes/spots also appear on the pedicels of banana flowers. Chlorosis (loss of green color) may occur between the veins of the leaves, resulting in whitish streaks. The bunch yield decreases depending on the stage at which the plant is affected by the disease. If the plant is affected at an early stage, the bunch yield decreases significantly. Such bunches do not fetch good prices in the market. This disease spreads to new plantations through suckers. In the garden, it spreads from virus-infected trees to the suckers of healthy plants through aphids.   
Leaf Streak: This disease is also caused by a virus. It affects all varieties. However, the "Karpura Chakkarakeli" (Poovan) variety is highly susceptible. The leaves of infected plants develop chlorotic streaks and streaks resembling dry spots. Diseased plants do not produce proper bunches. The intensity of the disease increases in "Karshi" gardens. This disease spreads to healthy plants in the garden through suckers.   
Management of Virus Diseases:
Virus diseases spread to new plantations through suckers. Therefore, great care should be taken in selecting suckers. Suckers should only be collected from healthy gardens. It is very important for farmers to recognize the symptoms of virus-infected plants to avoid selecting them. If disease symptoms are visible in the mother plant or suckers, the entire plant, including the rhizome, should be considered virus-infected. The banana gardens from which suckers are collected should not have more than 5% virus-infected plants. First, virus-infected banana plants in the sucker selection garden should be identified, removed along with their rhizomes, and burned outside the garden. Then, spray the plants in the garden, including the suckers, thoroughly with a solution of either Dimethoate or Methyl Demeton (2 ml per liter of water). Two days later, healthy suckers from the second harvest should be dug up. The outer skin of the dug-up suckers should be peeled thinly, and the suckers should be dipped in a copper oxychloride solution (5 grams per liter of water) for 15 minutes before planting. Currently, farmers are hiring laborers to dig up suckers, which prevents them from taking necessary precautions. This increases the chance of planting virus-infected suckers in the gardens. Therefore, farmers should develop an understanding of how to identify virus diseases and select suckers themselves with special care.   
Diseased plants in the garden should be identified and removed along with their rhizomes, cut into small pieces, and burned outside the garden with dry waste.   
When cutting suckers, avoid cutting suckers from diseased plants and only cut suckers from healthy plants.   
Aphids and mealybugs spread virus diseases in the garden, so they should be controlled by spraying with Dimethoate or Methyl Demeton (2 ml per liter of water).   
Depending on the intensity of the disease, banana gardens should not be maintained beyond one or two "Karshis" (seasons).   
Farmers are bringing suckers from distant places (other states) due to their fascination for new varieties without knowing the presence and intensity of virus diseases. This is also causing virus diseases to spread in our state.   
Diseases Affecting Bunches and Stems:
Crown Rot: Dry spots form on the crown due to sun exposure, gradually leading to rot. When the bunch weight increases, the rotten crown breaks, and the bunch falls off. Sometimes, the fruits in the bunch do not develop properly.   
Control Measures:
If banana leaves are wrapped around the crown, dry spots will not form on them.   
The spotted crown should be thoroughly sprayed with Carbendazim (1 gram per liter of water).   
Cigar End Rot: This disease mainly affects "Pedda Pacha Arati," "Chinna Pacha Arati" (Cavendish varieties), and "Tella Chakkarakeli" banana varieties during the rainy season. Black, burnt rot spots form at the tip of the fruit, resembling the burnt end of a cigar. The disease appears on a few fruits in the bunch initially and gradually spreads to many fruits. Unripe fruits are highly susceptible to this disease. This disease causes bunches to be unsold in the market, or their price drops significantly.   
Control Measures:
In the early stages of the disease, the affected fruits should be removed and burned.   
The bunches should be thoroughly sprayed twice with Carbendazim (1 gram of fungicide per liter of water) at an interval of 15 days.   
Post-Harvest Diseases of Banana: Various diseases can affect and damage bananas during post-harvest storage. The main ones are Anthracnose (spots on fruits), Hand Rot (Crown Rot), and Cigar End Rot.   
Control Measures: Immediately after cutting the hands (of bananas), they should be dipped in a one percent solution of potassium aluminum sulfate (alum), dried, and stored in polythene bags with a gauge of 150.   
Ways to Use Banana Fruit: Banana fruit is easily digestible, so it can be consumed by children and adults with stomach ailments. Various products such as "Taandra" (fruit leather), pulp, juice, powder, puree, chocolate, and alcohol can be made from ripe bananas.   
Other Uses: Starch can be extracted from raw fruits and banana stems. Banana flowers and the inner stem can be used in cooking. The juice extracted from the banana stem is used in Ayurvedic medicine to dissolve kidney stones. The leaves are used as dining plates. Fiber extracted from banana stems is used to make mats, decorative items, bags, hats, nets, ropes, etc. Leaves and chopped stems can be used as fodder for cattle and pigs. Banana trees are used as decorations at entrances during auspicious occasions. Freshly dried leaves can be used instead of dry grass in mushroom cultivation. Importantly, after harvesting the bunch, the remaining stem and rhizomes, when chopped into small pieces and plowed into the soil, act as organic fertilizer and make the soil very fertile.
